"""Carry names over from a sibling decomp: games by the same team often link the same in-house
library (an engine, a maths or model layer) that no SDK table knows. Stdlib only.

    sibling_names.py <named repo> <your repo> [--apply]

Both repos are decomp repos as this skill makes them (BASE, 1ST_READ.BIN, functions.txt). Each of
the sibling's named functions of 32 bytes or more is compared, with addresses and pool words
masked (sdk_masked.py's mask), against your code from each of your function starts, over the
sibling's length (the two analyses can end the same function at different bytes). A name is proposed only when the
match is exact and unique both ways: one sibling function matches exactly one of yours. Two or more
on either side (twins: the same code linked twice, or a family of copies) are listed, not named:
decide those by reading the callers.

Without --apply it prints the proposals; with it, it renames them in your functions.txt (review
the diff, then re-run split_asm.py and build.sh: still MATCH). Near matches are not proposed: a
changed constant can be a different function.
